# Incident Response & Forensics

## Incident Response Process
**Preparation**
- The big plan
- Who's doing what
- Organize types of incidents that might happen

**Reporting**
- What reports go to whom?
- Escalation

**Identification**
- Recognize what incident has ocurred
- Report from users
- Check the monitoring tools you use
- Watch alerts and logs
- Assess the impact
- Define who's involved

**Containment**
- Mitigate the damage
- Stop the attack
- Segregate the network
- Shutdown the system
- Turn off a service

**Eradication**
- Remove the malware
- Close off vulnerabilities
- Add new controls

**Recovery**
- Restore from backups
- Pull from snapshots
- Hire replacemente personnel
- Monitor to ensure good operation

**Documentation**
- Document the incident
- What failed?
- What worked?

## Incident Response Plan
**CIRT-Cyber incident response team**
- A group of people whose job is to response to all incident
- Full or part time - or both
- IT Security Team
- IT Department
- Human Resources
- Legal
- Public Relations

**Document incident types / Category definitions**
- Physical access
- Malware Phishing
- Social engineering
- Data access

**Roles and Responsabilities**
- Users 
- Help Desk
- Human Resources
- Database manager
- Incident Hotline
- IR manager/ IR officer
- IR team

**Reporting Requirements / Escalation**
- Determine Severity
- Based on severity have a clear chain of escalation
- Informing law enforcement

**Practice**
- Annual scenario drills 

## Digital Forensics
Digital forensics is the process of uncovering and interpreting electronic data. The goal of the process is to preserve any evidence in its most original form while performing a structured investigation by collecting, identifying and validating the digital information for the purpose of reconstructing past events.

The context is most often for usage of data in a court of law, though digital forensics can be used in other instances.

### Chain of Custody
*The whole idea of hcina of custody is to show good integrity of the evidence itself.*
- Gathering Evidence - data is of high integrity

#### **Chain of Custody Process**
1. Define the Evidence
2. Document collection method
3. Data/time collected
4. Person(s) handling the evidence
5. Function of person handling evidence (qualified person)
6. All locations of the evidence (i.e inital collection, moved to law enforcement...)

### **Order of Volatility**
*The order of volatility is a process that **enumerates when, where, and how to gather the data/evidence before the data changes or disappears***.
- **Memory**
	- Caches
	- Routing tables
	- ARP tables
- **Data on the Disk**
	- Optical, flash drives
	- Cache files, temp files
	- Write blocks enabled tools
- **Remotely logged data**
	- Web site data
	- Remote file server logs
	- Backups
- **Backups**
	- Trends
	- Low volatility takes time to gather data

### **Forensic Data Acquisition**
*Checklist of issues you should consider when you're performing Digital Forensics.*

1. Capture the system image
2. Netwrok traffic and logs
3. Capture video 
	- Security cameras
	- Record time offset
4. Take Hashes
5. Take screenshots
6. Interview witnesses
7. Track man hours

## Contingency Planning
*Attempts to mitigate adverse incidents to preserve business continuity*.
- How do we recover from a specific type of a disaster?
- What to do for keep the **Business Continuity** going?

### Disaster Recovery - Evacuation Plan
- **Backup Sites**
	- **Cold site**
		- It takes weeks to bring online
		- Basic office spaces (i.e building, chairs, AC...)
		- No operational equipment
		- Cheapest recovery site
	- **Warm site**
		- It takes days to bring online
		- Operational equipment but little or no data
	- **Hot site**
		- It take hours to bring online
		- Real-time synchronization
		- Almost all data ready to go - often just a quick update
		- Very expensive

- **Distance & Location** - different backup sites
- **Internet requirements**
- **Housing & entertainment**
- **Legal Issues** 

### Order of Restoration
- Power
- Wired LAN (is open and running)
- ISP link (running)
- Active Directory/DNS/DHCP server (up and cooking)
- Account servers 
- Sales and account workstations
- Production servers
- Production workstation
- Wireless access
- Peripherals (Printers, Camers, Scanners, faxes...)

**Annual exercises**<br>
**Failover** - simpe means the process of making recovery site happen.<br>
**Alternative Processing Sites** - different types of processing sites<br>
**Alternative business practices**<br>
**After action reports** - A clear and detailed documentation of everything that happened so that if it ever happens again you'll be ready to handle any form of business contingency planning.

ðŸ›‘ Through planning and practice is what makes recovery plans successful when disasters occur

## Backups
- `stat` **Linux** command - stat can return the status of an entire file system, the status of the first hard disk and so on.

</p>

- Archive attribute - **Windows** - if something is created or changed

### **Differential Backup**
- Backup all the changes since the last full backup

</p>

ðŸ›‘ *Differential there are less backup sets but they get bigger.*<br>

### **Incremental Backup**
- Only backs up changes made from last backup

</p>

ðŸ›‘ *Incremental more backup sets but smaller.*

### **Snapshots**
Snapshots typically under virtual machines and they are an absolute perfect way of making a copy of something that's happened in the past.

### What Media
- External hard-drive
- Tape
- Cloud

### Offsite Backup
Remote backup is good for disasters in general.

### Cloud Backup
Cloud backups work beautifully, however, they have one big downside and that is they take up a tremendous amount of time to get the initial backups going.
