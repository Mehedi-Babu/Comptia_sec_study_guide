# Architecture and Design

## Switches
A network switch is networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to receive and forward data to the destination device. A network switch is a multiport network bridge that uses **MAC addresses** to forward data at the **data link layer of the OSI model.**

</p>

* Filter & forward data based on **MAC address**
* Where VLANs are set up
* **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)** prevents bridge loop / loop floods

ðŸ›‘ Bridge Loop/Switching Loop - A switching loop or bridge loop occurs in computer networks when there is more than one Layer 2 path between two endpoints. The loop creates broadcast storms as broadcasts and multicasts are forwarded by switches out every port, the switch or switches will repeatedly rebroadcast the broadcast messages flooding the network.

### VLANs
A virtual LAN is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer. LAN is the abbreviation for local area network and in this context virtual refers to a physical object recreated and altered by additional logic.

* Provides layer 2 separation of networks
* Flood guarding
	* **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) - enable**

## Routers
Router is a networking device which helps in routing the data packets between home network & other networks.

* Filter & forward based on **IP address** 
* Allocates IP addresses to the devices connected to it using a DHCP server.
* It performs NAT (Network Address Translation)

ðŸ›‘ *Generally operates in the Network layer*

ðŸ›‘ A firewall is a piece of software that is commonly run on a gateway router which protects us from the evils of the Internet, so it can forward and filter based on port numbers, based on IP addresses, URL's, all kinds of different stuff. **So we would call this a network firewall because the gateway is running the firewall software** and protecting us from the evil of the Internet.

## Network Topologies - Basics
The actual organization of a network in terms of how is the data moving around and the best way to do it.

### LAN - Local Area Network

* A LAN is a network that has a logical and physical borders that a computer can broadcast

</p>


### WAN - Wide Area Network

* WAN is a multiple LANs or additional WANs with routing functionality for interconnectivity.

### MAN - Metropolitan Area Network

</p>

### Internet
Connecting WANs through WANs until complete the entire world = Internet.

* The protocol which runs the internet is TCP/IP
* As long you're using legitimate IPv4 address or IPv6

### Intranet
If you're using the TCP/IP stack and making your own LAN or WAN = Intranet.

* Intranet is a private network which still runs TCP/IP
