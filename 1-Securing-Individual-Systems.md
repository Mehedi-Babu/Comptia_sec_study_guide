# Securing Individual Systems 

## Denial-of-Service (DoS)
Prevents others from accessing a system / comprimising the availability.
### Attack Types

* **Volumetric Attack**
  * Ping Flood
  * UDP Flood
* **Protocol Attack**
  * SYN Flood/TCP SYN Attack
* **Application Attack**
  * SlowLoris Attack - *(tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible)*

* **Amplification Attack**
Generate a high volume of packets to flood the target website without alerting the intermediary, by returning a large reply to a small request. The basic defense against these attacks is blocking spoofed-source packets.

* **Smurf Attack** - flooded with spoofed ping messages.

## Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
Uses multiple systems to attack a single host - Generally controlled by **BotNets**, which is a type of malware that uses remotely controlled malicious software to control a large range of computers.

## Host Threats
* **Spam**

* **Phishing & Spear Phishing** - The difference between both is that Spear Phishing is for targeted individuals with some type of information about the victim embeded.

* **Spim** - Phishing through instant messaging

* **Vishing** - Unsolicited use of voice to get sensitive information

* **Click Jacking** - malicious click bait sites that forces you type your PII or download some malicious software.

* **Typo squatting** - Mistype URL's (i.e. - facebook.corn)

* **Domain Hijacking** - the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of its original registrant, or by abuse of privileges on domain hosting and registrar software systems.

* **Privilege Escalation**   

## Man-in-the-Middle Attack
* Third-party intercepting between a two-party conversation
* Uses the information to the third party's advantage

* Wireless MITM 
	* 802.11
	* Bluetooth

* Wired MITM
	* Spoof MAC address, IP address, ARP, DNS...

* Typosquatting

* Domain Hijacking

* Replay atack - when an attacker detects a data transmission and fraudulently has it delayed or repeated 

* Downgrade attack - is a cryptographic attack that makes it change the encrypted connection to the older one (i.e. cleartext).

* Session Hijacking - Inject information on middle of connection 

## System Resiliency
Generally they handle risks better, adding technologies and processes to enable the system recovery easily.

### Scalability
Adding more resources to take care the demand (manually added)

### Elasticity
The resources grow on demand as they required (i.e. IaaS)

### Redundancy - Distributed Allocation
*Is a form of distributive allocation.*

* Mass storage
* Redundant systems
* Redundant networks

*You can create more than one copy of non-OS critical data so that if one copy dies, another copy is ready to go to keep the systems up and running.*

### Non-persistance
*Is data that is collected but will not be saved on restart.*

* Snapshots - take the current state of something (i.e binary level) and store. A snapshot reverts to known state.
* Virtualization
* Revert/rollbacks tools - The rollback method bring the system back to a previous state. (i.e. Bad Driver, broken Updated etc).
* Live boot

## RAID - (Redudant Array of Independent Disks) 
Different levels of RAID arrays or combination is for:

* Improve disk access. 
* Improve fault tolerance and data integrity.
* Or both

![raid](https://ipwithease.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_57f86df8509a6.png)

### RAID 0
* **Has no data integrity.**
* **Improves speed** - data striping(divide the data into pieces in X hard drives); RAID0 speeds up performance but has no integrity, because if one of these hard drives fail, the data is lost.

### RAID 1
* **Has data integrity** - but doesn't have performance ; slow process because the data processed in all hard drives.

### RAID 5 
* **Has disk striping with parity** - parity information is spread across all disks evenly; 1/n of the total disk space available is used for parity. You can only loose one drive and keep the data, the problem is if you loose more than one drive.

### RAID 6
* **Disk parity with double distributed parity** - Same as RAID 5 but has one more parity which you can loos two drives and keep your data safe.

### RAID 0+1  (01)
* **Disk striping with mirroring** - combines both RAID levels 0 and 1 for performance and redundancy; a mirror of two striped arrays.

### RAID 1+0 (10)
* **Disk mirroring with striping** - combines both RAID level 0 and 1 for performance and redundancy; a strip of two mirrored arrays.

ðŸ›‘ **The most common RAID styles includes 0, 1, 5 and 10.**

ðŸ›‘ **RAID 1 and RAID 0 requires at least 2 drives.**

ðŸ›‘ **RAID 5 requires 3 or more drives and RAID 10 requires 4 drives.** 

## NAS and SAN
Storage area networks and network-attached storage both provide networked storage solutions. A NAS is a single storage device that operates on data files, while a SAN is a local network of several devices.

</p>

### Network Attached Storage (NAS)
* Runs over a standard network
* Shows up as normal shares on network
* Good for small environments
* **File-level**


### Storage Area Networks (SAN)
* **SAN runs on block-level storage**
* Fibre Channel (FC) or iSCSI 
* Expensive implementation

## Physical Hardening
**Policies can control how system hardware acts or reacts to an action**.

* Removable media controls

* **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)**
DEP is refer to Windows, in generic term is *Executable space protection*; DEP is almost always on by default on Windows. 

ðŸ›‘ DEP should be always be on, quietly protecting systems from buffer overflows. **The need to turn off DEP is rare**.

* Disabling Ports (can be done in the BIOS); Turn off legacy non-active ports to avoid vulnerable entry point.

## RFI and EMI
### Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
Is a disturbance generated by an external source that affects an electrical circuit by electromagnetic induction, electrostatic coupling, or conduction.

* Shielded twisted pair (STP) cable.
* Creating a distance between the device generating the EMI, or shield the emanating device or media.

### Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
RFI is EMI that transmits in the **radio frequency** range. (i.e. 802.11, cellular WAN radio bands)...

* Both 802.11 and cellular WANs almost always have automatic channel-hopping features that automatically tune devices to the least congested channel.

### Electrostatic discharge (ESD)
Discharge of an electrical current through the air, arcing from a point of a relative positive charge to a point of a relative negative charge.

* Protect equipment by shielding it in protective cases
* Only use properly grounded power supplies
* Anti-ESD wrist strap 

## Host Hardening

* **Disabling Unecessary Services**  - i.e. SSH server, Apache server...
* **Default Passwords** - Simply avoid default passwords and use good password methodologies.
* **Disabling Unecessary Accounts** - i.e. Windows default guest account, Duplicate accounts...
* **Patch Management**  
	1. Monitoring patches
		* Might not get reminders
	2. Testing the patches on Sandbox 
	3. Evaluating
	4. Deploying the patch
		* Scheduling
	5. Document what is patched 

### Anti-Malware

* Training for users
* Procedures
	* Best practices
* Monitoring 
* IDS
* Third-party anti-malware tools

### Host Firewalls

* **Whitelist**
	* Defines all the applications a user is allowed to install

* **Blacklist**
	* Blocked programs

## Data & System Security

* Data integrity
* Speed/performance quick access
* High availability

### Solutions to secure data:
#### RAID
* Provides Good integrity
* Provides Good speed
* Affordable

#### Clustering - Distributive allocation
The primary rationale for server clusters is protection against outages and downtime. 
 There are three main reasons for server clustering. They are availability, scalability, and reliability. The key to a protected IT infrastructure lies in redundancy.

* Good method to protect not only Data, but system resources
* Clustering is Expensive

#### Load Balancing
Refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.

* Distributes work loads across multiple machines

#### Virtualize the serves 

* Scalability
* High-availability comes from elasticity
* Snapshots 
* Affordable

## Disk Encryption

*Usage:*

* Mobile and Portable devices
	* Laptops, smartphones, tablets

* Desktop Systems with limited security

### TPM - Trusted Platform Module
Microchip built into a computer hardware that is used to store cryptographic information(public/private key). (i.e **BitLocker** 1.2+)

*examples of disk encryption TPM and non-TPM:*

* BitLocker (for Windows - TPM)
* PGP Disk (non-TPM)
* TrueCrypt (non-TPM)
* FileVault (for macOS - non-TPM)
