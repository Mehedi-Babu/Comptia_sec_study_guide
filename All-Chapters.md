# Brief Introduction
Information security, sometimes shortened to infosec, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It is part of information risk management. It typically involves preventing or at least reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access, use, disclosure, disruption, deletion/destruction, corruption, modification, inspection, recording or devaluation, although it may also involve reducing the adverse impacts of incidents.

## Goals of Security 

The CIA triad is put into pratice through various security mechanisms and controls. Every security technique, practice, and mechanism put into place to protect systems and data relates in some fashion to ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

<p align="center">
<b>The CIA Triad</b>
</p>
<p align="center">
<img width="50%" src="https://cyberdirective.com/wp-content/uploads/cyberdir/CIATriad-300x261.png" />
</p>

### **Confidentiality**: 
Keeping systems and data from being accessed, seen, read to anyone who is not authorized to do so. 

### **Integrity**: 
Protect the data from modification or deletion by unauthorized parties, and ensuring that when authorized people make changes that shouldn't have been made the damage can be undone.

### **Availability**:
Systems, access channels, and authentication mechanisms must all be working properly for the information they provide and protect to be available when needed.

**Note: In addition, other properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved. (ISO/IEC 27000:2009)**

### **Auditing & Accountability**
Basically keep tracking of everthing, like, who's been logging in when are they loggin in whose access this data.

### **Non-Repudiation**
Anyone can validate the authenticity of a message as well as the source of the message.

# 1. Securing Individual Systems 

## Denial-of-Service (DoS)
Prevents others from accessing a system / comprimising the availability.
### Attack Types

* **Volumetric Attack**
  * Ping Flood
  * UDP Flood

* **Protocol Attack**
  * SYN Flood/TCP SYN Attack

* **Application Attack**
  * SlowLoris Attack - *(tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold them open as long as possible)*

* **Amplification Attack**
Generate a high volume of packets to flood the target website without alerting the intermediary, by returning a large reply to a small request. The basic defense against these attacks is blocking spoofed-source packets.

* **Smurf Attack** - flooded with spoofed ping messages.

## Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
Uses multiple systems to attack a single host - Generally controlled by **BotNets**, which is a type of malware that uses remotely controlled malicious software to control a large range of computers.

## Host Threats
* **Spam**

* **Phishing & Spear Phishing** - The difference between both is that Spear Phishing is for targeted individuals with some type of information about the victim embeded.

* **Spim** - Phishing through instant messaging

* **Vishing** - Unsolicited use of voice to get sensitive information

* **Click Jacking** - malicious click bait sites that forces you type your PII or download some malicious software.

* **Typo squatting** - Mistype URL's (i.e. - facebook.corn)

* **Domain Hijacking** - the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of its original registrant, or by abuse of privileges on domain hosting and registrar software systems.

* **Privilege Escalation**   

## Man-in-the-Middle Attack

<p align="center">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/MITM_Diagramm.png" />
</p>

* Third-party intercepting between a two-party conversation
* Uses the information to the third party's advantage

* Wireless MITM 
	* 802.11
	* Bluetooth

* Wired MITM
	* Spoof MAC address, IP address, ARP, DNS...

* Typosquatting

* Domain Hijacking

* Replay atack - when an attacker detects a data transmission and fraudulently has it delayed or repeated 

* Downgrade attack - is a cryptographic attack that makes it change the encrypted connection to the older one (i.e. cleartext).

* Session Hijacking - Inject information on middle of connection 

## System Resiliency
Generally they handle risks better, adding technologies and processes to enable the system recovery easily.

### Scalability
Adding more resources to take care the demand (manually added)

### Elasticity
The resources grow on demand as they required (i.e. IaaS)

### Redundancy - Distributed Allocation
*Is a form of distributive allocation.*

* Mass storage
* Redundant systems
* Redundant networks

*You can create more than one copy of non-OS critical data so that if one copy dies, another copy is ready to go to keep the systems up and running.*

### Non-persistance
*Is data that is collected but will not be saved on restart.*

* Snapshots - take the current state of something (i.e binary level) and store. A snapshot reverts to known state.
* Virtualization
* Revert/rollbacks tools - The rollback method bring the system back to a previous state. (i.e. Bad Driver, broken Updated etc).
* Live boot

## RAID - (Redudant Array of Independent Disks) 
Different levels of RAID arrays or combination is for:

* Improve disk access. 
* Improve fault tolerance and data integrity.
* Or both

![raid](https://ipwithease.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_57f86df8509a6.png)

### RAID 0
* **Has no data integrity.**
* **Improves speed** - data striping(divide the data into pieces in X hard drives); RAID0 speeds up performance but has no integrity, because if one of these hard drives fail, the data is lost.

### RAID 1
* **Has data integrity** - but doesn't have performance ; slow process because the data processed in all hard drives.

### RAID 5 
* **Has disk striping with parity** - parity information is spread across all disks evenly; 1/n of the total disk space available is used for parity. You can only loose one drive and keep the data, the problem is if you loose more than one drive.

### RAID 6
* **Disk parity with double distributed parity** - Same as RAID 5 but has one more parity which you can loos two drives and keep your data safe.

### RAID 0+1  (01)
* **Disk striping with mirroring** - combines both RAID levels 0 and 1 for performance and redundancy; a mirror of two striped arrays.

### RAID 1+0 (10)
* **Disk mirroring with striping** - combines both RAID level 0 and 1 for performance and redundancy; a strip of two mirrored arrays.

ðŸ›‘ **The most common RAID styles includes 0, 1, 5 and 10.**

ðŸ›‘ **RAID 1 and RAID 0 requires at least 2 drives.**

ðŸ›‘ **RAID 5 requires 3 or more drives and RAID 10 requires 4 drives.** 

## NAS and SAN
Storage area networks and network-attached storage both provide networked storage solutions. A NAS is a single storage device that operates on data files, while a SAN is a local network of several devices.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/w4dk2kMnVAycdG6bCGRmjVShV30=/768x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/san-vs-nas-818005-v2-5c1042ba46e0fb0001bf6882.png" />
</p>

### Network Attached Storage (NAS)
* Runs over a standard network
* Shows up as normal shares on network
* Good for small environments
* **File-level**


### Storage Area Networks (SAN)
* **SAN runs on block-level storage**
* Fibre Channel (FC) or iSCSI 
* Expensive implementation

## Physical Hardening
**Policies can control how system hardware acts or reacts to an action**.

* Removable media controls

* **Data Execution Prevention (DEP)**
DEP is refer to Windows, in generic term is *Executable space protection*; DEP is almost always on by default on Windows. 

ðŸ›‘ DEP should be always be on, quietly protecting systems from buffer overflows. **The need to turn off DEP is rare**.

* Disabling Ports (can be done in the BIOS); Turn off legacy non-active ports to avoid vulnerable entry point.

## RFI and EMI
<p align="center">
<img width="60%" src="https://www.precisionmicro.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/etched-emi-shielding-header.jpg" />
</p>

### Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
Is a disturbance generated by an external source that affects an electrical circuit by electromagnetic induction, electrostatic coupling, or conduction.

* Shielded twisted pair (STP) cable.
* Creating a distance between the device generating the EMI, or shield the emanating device or media.

### Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
RFI is EMI that transmits in the **radio frequency** range. (i.e. 802.11, cellular WAN radio bands)...

* Both 802.11 and cellular WANs almost always have automatic channel-hopping features that automatically tune devices to the least congested channel.

### Electrostatic discharge (ESD)
Discharge of an electrical current through the air, arcing from a point of a relative positive charge to a point of a relative negative charge.

* Protect equipment by shielding it in protective cases
* Only use properly grounded power supplies
* Anti-ESD wrist strap 

## Host Hardening

* **Disabling Unecessary Services**  - i.e. SSH server, Apache server...
* **Default Passwords** - Simply avoid default passwords and use good password methodologies.
* **Disabling Unecessary Accounts** - i.e. Windows default guest account, Duplicate accounts...
* **Patch Management**  
	1. Monitoring patches
		* Might not get reminders
	2. Testing the patches on Sandbox 
	3. Evaluating
	4. Deploying the patch
		* Scheduling
	5. Document what is patched 

### Anti-Malware

* Training for users
* Procedures
	* Best practices
* Monitoring 
* IDS
* Third-party anti-malware tools

### Host Firewalls

* **Whitelist**
	* Defines all the applications a user is allowed to install

* **Blacklist**
	* Blocked programs

## Data & System Security

* Data integrity
* Speed/performance quick access
* High availability

### Solutions to secure data:
#### RAID
* Provides Good integrity
* Provides Good speed
* Affordable

#### Clustering - Distributive allocation
The primary rationale for server clusters is protection against outages and downtime. 
 There are three main reasons for server clustering. They are availability, scalability, and reliability. The key to a protected IT infrastructure lies in redundancy.

* Good method to protect not only Data, but system resources
* Clustering is Expensive

#### Load Balancing
Refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.

* Distributes work loads across multiple machines

#### Virtualize the serves 

* Scalability
* High-availability comes from elasticity
* Snapshots 
* Affordable

### Disk Encryption

*Usage:*

* Mobile and Portable devices
	* Laptops, smartphones, tablets

* Desktop Systems with limited security

### TPM - Trusted Platform Module
Microchip built into a computer hardware that is used to store cryptographic information(public/private key). *(i.e **BitLocker** 1.2+)*; The OS relies on this **hardware of root trust** to check for low-level changes at boot up.

*examples of disk encryption TPM and non-TPM:*

* BitLocker (for Windows - TPM)
* PGP Disk (non-TPM)
* TrueCrypt (non-TPM)
* FileVault (for macOS - non-TPM)

ðŸ›‘ **BitLocker is a built-in Windows Utility Drive Encryption Tool; must have a recovery key to access the data.**

#### Secure Boot - TPM
During the boot process, the TPM and UEFI generate reports about the process and can send those reports to a remote system, like a central authentication server. This process is called **remote authentication** / remote attestation.

### Hardware / Firmware Security

* **Full Disk Encryption (FDE)**
	* i.e. Windows - BitLocker

* **Self-encrypting Drive (SED)**

### Hardware Security Module (HSM)
Is any type of hardware that's designed to do security work. For ATMs, Web Servers, or other applications that perform an unusually high amount of key handling, it's usually a good idea to offload this work to other hardware.

## Secure OS Types

* **Server OS** [RedHat Server, Windows Server etc]
 * Built-in functionality 
 * Connections
 
* **Workstation** [Linux Ubuntu, Windows 10 etc]
	* Desktop version
	* Workhorse

* **Embedded Systems** [Routers, CCTVs etc]
	* Appliance
	* Their own OS

* **Kiosk** [i.e. Big Touch Screens on Museums, Mall etc]
	* Limited function 

* **Mobile OS**
	* Apple iOS
  * Android OS

ðŸ›‘ *Picking an OS based on least functionality is a good security practice.*


## Secure Peripherals
- Keyboards, USB flash drivers, printers, monitors and so on.

* Patch!
* Disable unecessary ports
* Avoid backdoors

### Bluetooth Security

**Bluejacking** - When bad actors connects with any Device that have Bluetooth enable by default.

**Bluesnarfing** - When the attacker steals data from the target device by connecting to an unsuspecting user's device.

*Types of bluetooth*:

* Class1 is 328' foot 
* Class2 is 33' foot
* Class3 is 3' foot

ðŸ›‘ *Most Mobile phones and Bluetooth headsets are class2 - range upto 33'*

### 802.11
Many peripherals can connect to an 802.11 network as a host. Printers and multifunction devices (MFDs) are very commonly connected with 802.11.

## Malwares
*Viruses do things to files and propagates, Malware collect keystrokes and information*

#### Virus

* Piece of malicious software
* Attach to other files
* Propagate
* Spread to other devices
* Active

#### Adware

* Web-centric 
* Programs that pop-up unecessary advertisment

#### Spyware

* Hide from system
* Tracking your web brownsing
* Stealing cookies

#### Trojans

* Standalone programs that must be installed **disguised** in programs
* Deliver payload without users knowledge
* Backdoor access

#### RAT - Remote Access Trojan

* Mimic the behavior of legitimate remote control
* Can hide in common 'inofensive' programs like games
* Backdoor access

#### Ransomware - Crypto-Malware

* Uses some form of encryption to lock a user out of a system.
* Usually encrypting the boot drive
* Then forces the user to pay money to get the system decrypted
* Can devastate systems

#### Logic Bomb

* Are triggered by an event *(i.e. erasing file shares or disk storage at a certain time or date)*
* Can devastate systems

#### Rootkit

* Piece of software that escalates privileges to execute other things on computer
* Hard to detect

#### Backdoor

* Piece of software that work on obfuscating an remote access.

#### Polymorphic Malware

* Changes his own code to confuse the digital signature of anti-malware programs
* Hard to detect and destroy

#### Armored Virus

* Design to make harder the detection by anti-malware programs.
* Hard to detect and destroy

#### Keylogger

* Record keystrokes
* Inject scripts


## Analyzing Output

### Anti-Malware
* Almost all anti-malware tools include a point scanner and a mass storage scanner.

### Host-based Firewall
- Inbound rules / outbound rules

* All host based firewalls are basically they exclude everybody, so it is called an **implicity deny** *(not programs gets in or out)*

* The output is really an Access Control List
* Use of Least privilege and whitelisting 

ðŸ›‘ **False positive** - scan results identify a file that may not actually harm a system or is allowed on the system. (i.e. you just downloaded the Cain & Abel to crack some passwords on your assessment, probably Windows Defender will try to block it out).

### File Integrity Check
Verify the integrity of file is in good order and ready to run. 

**Basically to check if the file isn't:**

* corrupted
* tampered
* version and date

ðŸ›‘ *To create a file integrity check, you can Generate a hash from source code - checksum. If somebody tamper the file or change from source code, the output hash will be different.*

### Application Whitelisting
Everything about software management, application whitelisting, the main job - it's to make sure that users are running the right applications on each individual systems.

## IDS and IPS

![ips-ids](https://ipwithease.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/107-difference-between-ips-and-ids-in-network-security.png)

#### Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)  

* Lives inside the Network
* Watches within the network traffic
* Sends alerts on suspicious activity

#### Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

* Active IDS
* IPS is usually close to the edge the network
* Action to prevent will occur at the IPS device

ðŸ›‘ **IDS: notifies | IPS: acts to stop | Firewall: filters**

## Automation Strategies
*Automation is often used with various scans and updates based on configurable trigger.*

* Repetitive
* Consistent
* Template restoration
* Continuous monitoring network devices (i.e. SNMP)
* Automatic update from OS
* Monitoring host for application whitelists
* Application Development - continuous integration tools like fuzzing, static testing
* Built-in tools vs Shell Scripting to Automate (Powershell(Windows) , Bash(Linux) ..)

## Media Sanitization | Data Destruction 


### Clearing/Clear
Clear means to tell the device through user commands inherent to the massa storage device to sanitize the data. *(i.e. send commands to a hard drive to erase data)*

ðŸ›‘ Can be done with commands such as erase, format and delete (these methods are not final)

### Purge
Purging will process the device to remove data from the drive, the device might will no longer be usable. Means to use anything other than an internal command to sanitize the data on the media. *(i.e. Degausser: machine with a strong magnetic field that destroys/purge the data from massa storage devices)*

**purge also means that the device is basically not useful anymore**

### Crypto Erase
In case you lost the keys to encrypted device.

### Destroy / Data Destruction
Ruin the media in such a way tha it is no longer functional.

* Mass storage device
* Tape media
* Floppy disks
* Paper

#### Methods:

* Burning
* Pulping
* Shredding
* Pulverizing

# 2. Tools 

## OS Utilities - Command Line (Linux & Windows)

### ping
can be handful for DNS checks (up / or down) | is a DNS tool to resolves web addresses to an IP address.

```sh
ping www.google.com 

PING www.google.com (172.217.168.164): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.217.168.164: icmp_seq=0 ttl=55 time=25.981 ms
64 bytes from 172.217.168.164: icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=25.236 ms
--- www.google.com ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 25.236/25.608/25.981/0.373 ms

### netcat
TCP/IP swiss army knife; you can make any type of connection and see the results from a command line. With nc you can connect to anything on any port number or you can make your system listen on a port number. Can be an agressive tool for recon.

## Network Scanners
**Useful for collect and inventory the hosts on a network, and is useful for reconnaissance of your system.**

### Nmap
The Best way to query a system to check if they have open ports, services, system versions, service versions etc.

*Zenmap is a GUI version of Nmap.*

```sh
nmap -v -A -T5 scanme.nmap.org 

...

## Angry IP Scanner (GUI) - for Windows
Does a good job using simple protocols, mainly ping, to query a single IP address or an address range. 

## Protocol Analyzers
**Protocol Analyzers collect and inventory the network traffic.**

**Sniffer** - Some type of software that grab all the data that is going in and out of particular interface. 

### Why Protocol Analyze?
* Count all the packets coming through over a certain time period to get a strong ideas to your network utilization.
* Inspect packets for single protocols to verify they are working properly.
* Monitor communication between client and a server to look for problems.
* Look for servers that aren't authorized on the network.
* Find systems broadcasting bad data.
* Find problems in authentication by watching each step of the process.

### Wireshark
Wireshark is the worldâ€™s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer. It lets you see whatâ€™s happening on your network at a microscopic level.

*With Wirehsark you can inspect and detect ARP poisonings, Rogue DHCP servers, Broadcast Storm etc.*

ðŸ›‘ Broadcast Storm - when a NIC (or port on a switch) sends large amounts of broadcast traffic, thereby crippling network resources.

### tcpdump
Another popular protocol analyzer option for UNIX/Linux.

## SNMP - Simple Network Management Protocol
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard protocol for collecting and organizing information about managed devices on IP networks and for modifying that information to change device behavior. Devices that typically support SNMP include cable modems, routers, switches, servers, workstations, printers, and more.

* SNMP v1 - does not support encryption
* SNMP v2 - added basic encryption
* SNMP v3 - added TLS encryption  

**SNMP uses Port 161**

## Logging
There are two types of events (Network and Non-network events).

### Non-Network Logs
* Operation System Events
	* Host starting
	* Host shutdown
	* Reboot
	* Service starting, stopping, and failling
	* OS Updates

* Applications Events
	* Application Installation
	* Application starts, stops or crashes

* Security Events
	* Logons
	* Logons successes and failures

**Generic Log Structure:**
* Date and Time
* Process/Source/ID
* Account associated/System
* Event Number
* Event Description
* Network Logs

### Network Events

* O.S. / System-Level
	* Remote logon fail/not
	* Events on Shared Applicaton/Resources
		* Activity on Web Server (i.e. Apache)
		* Activity on Firewall

* Application-Level

### Centralized vs Descentralized Log Management
**Descentralized log management** - In environments such as very small networks and don't have large infrastructure or in isolated network segments, descentralized log management is usually the norm.

**Centralized log management** - means that the log files from different machines are automatically sent to a centralized logging facility or server, such as a syslog server, administrators review logs from a centralized loogging facility on the network. Enterprise correlate them into one unifed management interface, so the administrator can look for trends or events.

### Centralized
* Uses a Central repository
	* Drag on system
* Use SNMP Systems
	* Pulls informaton needed and generates graphs and charts

ðŸ›‘ Monitoring-as-a-Services (MaaS)


### SIEM - Security Information and Event Management
Collects data points from network, including **log files, traffic captures, SNMP messages, and so on**, from every host on the network. **SIEM can collect all this data into one centralized location and correlate it for analysis to look for security and performance issues, as well negative trends all in real time.**


### Continuos Monitoring
Is a proactive way of ensuring that the network administrator receives all the different logs and other data points throughout the network from all network devices and all systems, on a constant basis. This data is continually fed into.

### Auditing
Important part of ensuring accountability on the network. Examines the logs and other data points of certain events and construct a time frame and event sequence surrounding an incident.

Auditing also consists of other activities, such as:
* Performing Network Sniffing traffic analysis
* Password Cracking
* Vulnerability Assessment
* Penetration Test
* Compliance Audits

ðŸ›‘ *Auditing can reveal weak security configurations*

### Trend Analysis
Enables network administrator to correlate different data sources and data points from various places in the network, such as log files, IDS logs, wireless and wired sniffing as well as other event sources, and seek to identify on-going trends in both performance and security. The goal is find patterns that can indicate a emerging issue.

# 3. Networking - Basics

## Switches
A network switch is networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to receive and forward data to the destination device. A network switch is a multiport network bridge that uses **MAC addresses** to forward data at the **data link layer of the OSI model.**

<p align="center">
<img width="64%" src="https://cdn.networklessons.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/xcisco-smb-vlans.png.pagespeed.ic.O1ruqFKn-i.png)" />
</p>

* Filter & forward data based on **MAC address**
* Where VLANs are set up
* **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)** prevents bridge loop / loop floods

ðŸ›‘ **Bridge Loop/Switching Loop** - A switching loop or bridge loop occurs in computer networks when there is more than one Layer 2 path between two endpoints. The loop creates broadcast storms as broadcasts and multicasts are forwarded by switches out every port, the switch or switches will repeatedly rebroadcast the broadcast messages flooding the network.

### VLANs
A virtual LAN is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer. LAN is the abbreviation for local area network and in this context virtual refers to a physical object recreated and altered by additional logic.

</p>

* Provides layer 2 separation of networks
* **Flood guarding**
	* **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) - enable**

## Routers
Router is a networking device which helps in routing the data packets between home network & other networks.

<p align="center">
<img width="64%" src="https://geek-university.com/wp-content/images/ccna/how_routers_work.jpg" />
</p>

* Filter & forward based on **IP address** 
* Allocates IP addresses to the devices connected to it using a DHCP server.
* It performs NAT (Network Address Translation)

ðŸ›‘ *Generally operates in the Network layer*

ðŸ›‘ A firewall is a piece of software that is commonly run on a gateway router which protects us from the evils of the Internet, so it can forward and filter based on port numbers, based on IP addresses, URL's, all kinds of different stuff. **So we would call this a network firewall because the gateway is running the firewall software** and protecting us from the evil of the Internet.

## Network Topologies - Basics
The actual organization of a network in terms of how is the data moving around and the best way to do it.

### LAN - Local Area Network

* A LAN is a network that has a logical and physical borders that a computer can broadcast

<p align="center">
<img width="64%" src="https://www.geocities.ws/alcantara97/starhttt.gif" />
</p>

### WAN - Wide Area Network

* WAN is a multiple LANs or additional WANs with routing functionality for interconnectivity.

</p>


### MAN - Metropolitan Area Network 

<p align="center">
<img width="64%" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/f37cec4e00f726cb4be3661f20ccad77751e003a/man-topo.jpg" />
</p>

### Internet
Connecting WANs through WANs until complete the entire world = Internet.

* The protocol which runs the internet is TCP/IP
* As long you're using legitimate IPv4 address or IPv6
<p align="center">
<img width="64%" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/8c176b8a798fb5749c4391c45015ee5d14d56f13/internet.png" />
</p>

### Intranet
If you're using the TCP/IP stack and making your own LAN or WAN = Intranet.

* Intranet is a private network which still runs TCP/IP

<p align="center">
<img width="64%" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/8c176b8a798fb5749c4391c45015ee5d14d56f13/intranet.png" />
</p>

ðŸ›‘ **Extranet**: example of some vendor who need to access the Intranet network.

## Network Zones - Concepts

* **LAN** - the core of your network.

* **VLAN** - physical device that designate separate broadcast domains....

* **DMZ** - Demilitarized Zone: Perimeter network, isolating untrusted network from LAN area. DMZ is a firewall configuration used to secure hosts on a network segment, in most DMZs the hosts on the DMZ are connected behind a Firewall that is connected to a public network(internet).

<p align="center">
<img width="80%" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_cbXvML3JELc/TCRH6WvlEvI/AAAAAAAAAGg/7xsnkGmBqo0/s1600/111.gif" />
</p>

* **Wireless Network** - Basically a LAN connected to an Wireless Access Point (WAP).

* **Guest Network** - i.e. Coffee Shop network. 

* **Virtualization** 

* **Airgap** - Simply means a disconnect to provide real isolation and the use of a completely separate internet from the world; Private internet.

## Network Access Controls

* Wireless Network
* Remote Access
* VPN Access

### PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol
In computer networking, Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link layer (layer 2) communications protocol between two routers directly without any host or any other networking in between. It can provide connection authentication, transmission encryption, and compression. 

* Transport layer protocol
	* Initiate connection
	* Get address information
	* Make connection

* Poor authentication mechanisms:
	* PAP - password authentical protocol (passwords in the clear)
	* CHAP - Challenge handshake authentication protocol - (use of hashing)

### **EAP** - Extensible Authentication Protocol
Developed initially as an extension to the authentication part of PPP. EAP is only an extension for the protocol that having a connection, and was created as a better authentication method to PPP.

* **EAP - MD5**
	* basically MSCHAP
	* Takes those passwords and hashes them into MD5 hash

* **EAP - PSK**
	* Uses pre-determined symmetric keys
	* Similar to WPA and WPA-2

* **EAP - TLS**
	* Cand handle an entire TLS
	* Needs server and client certificates

* **EAP - TTLS**
	* Uses the TLS exchange method
	* Only requires server certificates

### Protocols that Encapsulates the EAP 

* **802.1X** - Full blown authentication standard that allows us to make connections between some type of client system. It provides an authentication mechanism to devices wishing to attach to a LAN or WLAN. 

* *Early EAP adaptations*:
	* **LEAP** (Cisco) - LEAP is weak nowdays
	* **PEAP** (Microsoft) - PEAP is weak nowdays 

## Network Firewalls - Concepts

### **Stateful** Firewall
Can watch traffic streams from end to end. They are aware of communications paths; Can implement varios IPSec functions (tunnels and encryption); Can tell what stage a TCP connection is in (open, open sent, synchronized SYN ACK or established).

* Are better at identifying unauthorized and forged communications.

### **Stateless** Firewall
They watch network traffic and restrict / block packets based on source and destination address or static values **(ACL Rules)**.

* Typically faster and perform better under havier traffic loads.

### Packet-filtering

* Inspect data packets (drop or forward), such as the destination and originiation IP address, packet type, port number and other surface-level information.

### Circuit-level firewall

* Quickly approve or deny traffic; verify transmission protocol (TCP) handshake (session).

### Application-level Firewall

* Filter traffic based on user group, group membership, application or services (works at layer 7 OSI - also called proxy firewall as well)

## Proxy Servers
A box/piece of software running on a computer acts an intermediary between two different devices having a session. 

* Application-specific
	* Web proxy
	* FTP proxy
	* VOIP proxy

### Forward Proxy
*The proxy simply forward the requests of respective client.*
 
* [Client -> **Proxy** -> Firewall -> Internet -> Server]

* **Hides the client**

* Provides:
	* Caching
	* Content filtering
	* Acts similar to firewall (block based on URL, content filtering and so on).


### Reverse Proxy Server
*Like a forward but complete reverse.*

* [Client <-  Internet <- Firewall <- **Proxy** <- Server]

* **Hides the servers**
	
* Provides
	* High security
	* Protect the servers
	* Handle DoS attacks
	* Load balancing
	* Caching
	* Encryption acceleration

## Honeypots

Emulate a web server, vulnerable machine purposely to attack; Inviting target to keep away from targets. 

* Benefit to see how threat actors, what techniques they're using, what vulnerabilities are they look for, what ports, and so on.

* Log all information (port information and the origin IP address)

* Usually located in the DMZ to get close to the source but still isolated to capture the traffic.

### Honeynet
A honeynet is a vulnerable and **simulated computer network** using a decoy server. **By design, honeynets are not authorized for any authentic uses. If a honeynet is accessed, a fair assumption is that the person accessing it is a bad actor.**

## VPN - Virtual Private Networks 
Organizations use virtual private networks (VPNs) to create an end-to-end private network connection (tunnel) over third-party networks such as the Internet or extranets.
The tunnel eliminates the distance barrier and enables remote users to access central site network resources.
The **IP Security (IPsec) protocol** provides a framework for configuring secure VPNs and is commonly deployed over the Internet to connect branch offices, remote employees, and business partners. Secure site-to-site VPNs, between central and remote sites, can be implemented using the IPsec protocol. IPsec can also be used in remote-access tunnels for telecommuter access.

### The two types of VPN - **Remote Access** and **Site-to-Site**
<p align="center">
<img width="73%" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/61b8c0d475d2e4d5dbb31bd9c8b8c25497f9dbf8/vpn+topologies.png" />
</p>

* A **remote-access** VPN is created when VPN information is not statically set up, but instead allows for dynamically changing information and can be enabled and disabled. Consider a telecommuter who needs VPN access to corporate data over the Internet. The telecommuter does not necessarily have the VPN connection set up at all times. The telecommuter's PC is responsible for establishing the VPN, each host typically has Cisco VPN client software. 

* A **site-to-site** VPN is created when connection devices on both sides of the VPN connection are aware of the VPN configuration in advance.

### VPN Setup Steps

1. Protocol to set up tunnel
2. Protocol to handle authentication and encryption

### Early VPNs Protocols

* **PPTP** - Point-to-Point tunneling Protocol
	* Oldest VPN protocol
	* Uses PPP for tunnel
	* Password only
	* **TCP port 1723**
	* Weak encryption

* **L2TP** - Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
	* Cisco proprietary
	* SImilar to PPTP
	* L2TP tunnel
	* IPsec encryption
	* **UDP ports 500, 1701, 4500**
	* 

* 'Pure' **IPsec**
	* uses IPsec for tunneling and encryption
	* Great for IPv6
	* **UDP ports 500, 4500**

* **SSL** and **TLS**
	* **TCP port 443**
	* Often works within a web browser
	* TUN/TAP (virtual network driver) tunnel
	* TLS encryption

* **OpenVPN**
	* Unique tunnel
	* Encryption based on SSL/TLS protocol
	* **TCP port 1194**, but can be changed 

## IPSec - IP Security
Is a suite of protocols developed to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and authentication of data communications over an IP network.

ðŸ›‘ IPSec works at the IP layer

### **IPSec Components**

1. **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)** â€“ It provides data integrity, encryption, authentication and anti replay. It also provides authentication for payload.

2. **Authentication Header (AH)** â€“ It also provides data integrity, authentication and anti replay and it does not provide encryption. The anti replay protection, protects against unauthorized transmission of packets. It does not protect dataâ€™s confidentiality.
<p align="center">
<img width="69%" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/newb.png" />
</p>

3. **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)** â€“ It is a network security protocol designed to dynamically exchange encryption keys and find a way over Security Association (SA) between 2 devices. The Security Association (SA) establishes shared security attributes between 2 network entities to support secure communication. **The Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) and Internet Security Association which provides a framework for authentication and key exchange.** ISAKMP tells how the set up of the Security Associations (SAs) and how direct connections between two hosts that are using IPsec.

<p align="center">
<img width="69%" src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/1212-2.png" />
</p>

### **Tunnel Mode and Transport Mode**
When IPsec protects traffic, it has a couple of services and modes to choose from.

**Transport mode** - preserving original IP header. Typically used in combination with GRE or other encapsulating protocols. (Host-to-Host)

**Tunnel mode** - encapsulating entire IP datagram within a new header, essentially tunneling the packet. (The gateway creates the tunnel)

1. *Some TCP data will be sent over:*
<p align="center">
<img width="69%" src="https://community.cisco.com/legacyfs/online/legacy/5/1/2/166215-Screen%20Shot%202013-11-12%20at%2011.52.30%20AM.png" />
</p>

2. *And now about how those IP protocols fit in the two modes.*
<p align="center">
<img width="69%" src="https://community.cisco.com/legacyfs/online/legacy/6/1/2/166216-Screen%20Shot%202013-11-12%20at%2011.52.17%20AM.png" />
</p>

The last mode is what is typically used with crypto map based IPsec VPNs.

#### Use of IPSec

* **VPNs**
	* Pure IPsec (using tunneling mode)
	* IPSec with L2TP (add a tunnel layer)

* **RADIUS and TACACS+**

* **IPSec with IPv6**

* **Using IPSec with Non-security protocols / Encrypting Unsecured Protocols**
	* i.e. IPsec over Telnet

## NIDS and NIPS
**Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDs)** and **Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (NIPS)** look at attacks coming into the network at large instead of into a host. Attacks could be in the form of malformed network traffic or excessive amounts of traffic.

### Prevention vs Detection
**NIDS** is a **passive** device and focuses on detection alone, making it a **detection control**. It detects network traffic issues and alerts and administrator to these issues, also logging the events in the process.

**NIPS** is /**inline**(Active) device and focuses not only on detecting network attacks, but preventing them. (block things from router)

### Detection
NIDS/NIPS solutions act very much like firewalls in that they inspect packets. 

**There's 4 types of detection methods:**

* **Behavioral/Anomaly** - Comparing traffic with a baseline of patterns considered normal for the network
* **Signature** - Preconfigured Signature-based
* **Rule** - Preconfigured rules in a ruleset - like firewall
* **Heuristic - (Anomaly and Signature)**

### Sensors: In-band & Out-of-Band

#### NIPS
* NIPS sensor must be installed **in-band** to your network traffic

<p align="center">
<img width="73%" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/a2fc0101b75e32a25150d516dcef9e8a9ef5ad86/NIPS.png" />
</p>

#### NIDS
* NIDS sensor, being **passive**, is normally installed **out-of-band**

<p align="center">
<img width="73%" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/a2fc0101b75e32a25150d516dcef9e8a9ef5ad86/NIDS.png" />
</p>
	
### Devices
#### Network Tap
Is a device that you can insert anywhere along a run to grab packets.

#### Port Mirror
Also called a Switch Port Analyzer, or SPAN in Cisco Devices, is a special port on a managed switch configured to listen for all data going in and out of the switch. Unlike a network tap, port mirroing is convenient and easily changed to reflect any changes in your NIDS/NIPS monitoring stragegy.


## SIEM - Security Information and Event Management
SIEM tools aggregate and correlate data, allowing you to organize it into valuable information. You can get to the time sequence of an event in all the logs quickly, have alerts and the ability to notify you based on a configurable trigger.

* **Aggregation** - Collecting data from disparate sources and organizing the data into a single format. Any device within a SIEM system that collects data is called collector or an aggregator.

* **Correlation** - is the logic that looks at data from disparate sources and can make determinations about events taking place on your network. (could be in-band or out-of-band, depending on the placement of the NIDS/NIPS)
	* Alerts - for notification if something goes bad
	* Triggering - Exceeding thresholds

* **Normalization** - will actually create multiple tables / organize in such a way that the data can become more efficient and allows our analysis and reports tools to work better.

* **WORM - Write Once Read Many**: The concept being is that log files are precious, and a lot of times you might want to look at them in an archival way, so that we can use optical media like WORM drives to store them.

#### Tools

* **Splunk**
* **ArcSight**
* **ELK - Elastic Search, Log Stash and Kibana (openSource)**

# 4) Identity and Access Management

## Identification and AAA
Identification, authentication, authorization, and accounting work together to manage assets securely.

### **Identification**
The information on credentials identifies the user.

### **Authentication**
* **Authentication Factors:**
  * Something you **know** (password)
  * Something you **have** (smart card)
  * Something you **are** (fingerprint)
  * Something you **do** (android pattern)
  * **Somewhere** you are (geolocation)
  * *Multi-factor authentication generally uses two of this examples (Something you Know and Something you Have), never on same category*
* **Trusts and Federated Authentication**:
   * **Trust Relationship** - Active Directory DS
   * **Transitive Trust** - The organization trusts another entity because they are trusted by someone else that the organization trusts.
   * **Federated System** - Common authentication and credentials database that multiple entities use and share. (Active Directory: Different Domains could be used in other domains in the same forest).

### **Authorization**
* **Permissions**: Applied to resources
* **Rights** / **Privileges**: Assign at system level 
* **Authorization strategies**:
  * Least privileged
  * Separation of Duties

### Authorization Models

* **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**:
	* Labelling
	* Used on old systems (i.e. Top Secret Gov. information)
* **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**:
	* Owner of the data defines access
	* Roles
* **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**:
	* Access to resources is defines by a set of rules
	* by Groups (i.e. Admin Groups --> Rights and Perms | Sales Group --> Rights and Perms)

#### ðŸ›‘ Access is defined by **ACL, Access Control List**.
#### ðŸ›‘ **Implicity deny** prevents access unless specifically permitted.

## Password Security
* **Complexity**
	* Length and character requirements

* **Expiration**
	* Reset and time triggers

* **Password history**
	* Reusage and retention

### Password Security
#### Password Policy (Local Security Policy - Windows)
* **Enforce Password History**: determine the number of new unique passwords [1-24]
* **Maximum Password Age**: Password age [1-999 days] 
* **Minimum Password Age**: Limit until request password change [1-998 days]
* **Maximum Password Lenght**: [1-20 characters]
* **Password Complexity:**
	* Not contain user account name or parts of full name
	* At least 6 characters lenght
	* At least three of four categories:
		* Uppercase [A-Z]
		* Lowercase [a-z]
		* Base 10 digits [0-9]
		* Non-alphabetic characters [!,@,#,$,...]

#### Account Lockout Policy
* **Account Lockout Duration**: Time (in minutes) for a locked-out account [0-99,999]
* **Account Lockout Threshold**: Number of failed logon attempts [0-999]
* **Reset Account Lockout Duration**: Period of time that must elapse before the account lockout counter is reset to 0 bad logon attempts. [1-99,999]

### Group Policy Objects (AD DS)
Set of rules that allow an administrator granular control over the configuration of objects in Active Directory, including user accounts, operation systems, applications and other AD objects. Can apply over multiple domains, groups and OU's.

## Linux - File Permissions

Linux has three permissions and they can be set for the owner, group or other.

**r = read** - open a file, view a file.<br>
**w = write** - edit a file, add or delete files for directories.<br>
**x = execute** - run a file, execute a program or script, CD to a different directory.<br>


Owner | Group | Other
--|--|--
rwx | rwx | rwx

* Viewing the permissions on Linux command-line:

```sh
ls -l
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

### Using `chmod` - to change file modes or Access Control Lists 
* Clear out the permissions of the **File** to have no read, write and execute permissions on **Other**:<br> *(The flag equals to nothing[o=] deny the permissions)*

```sh
ls -l
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File

chmod o= File

ls -l
-rwxrwx--- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

* Giving **read** and **write** permissions to **Group**:

```sh
ls -l
-rwx---r-- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File

chmod g=rw File

ls -l
-rwxrw-r-- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
``` 

* Giving **all permissions** to everybody(Owner,Group and Other):

```sh
ls -l
-rwx---r-- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File

chmod a=rwx File

ls -l
-rwxrwxrwx 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
``` 

### Using `chmod` on oldschool way:
The chmod command will take the octal value and combine them to associate the permissions on three different positions for the Owner, Group and Other/Everyone. This boils down to a simple binary rule: 0 = off | 1 = on.

Octal | Binary | Permissions
--|--|--
0 | 000 | ---
1 | 001 | --x
2 | 010 | -w-
3 | 011 | -wx
4 | 100 | r--
5 | 101 | r-x
6 | 110 | rw-
7 | 111 | rwx

*If you want to give all permissions to a group for example, the number will be 7 (4 + 2 + 1).*

Read | Write | Execute
--|--|--
r-- | -w- | --x
4 | 2 | 1

#### Examples:

* Giving **read, write and execute** permission to everybody:

```sh
ls -l
-rwx---r-- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File

chmod 777 File

ls -l
-rwxrwxrwx 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
``` 

* Giving all permissions to the **owner**, read and write to **group** and no permissions to **other/everyone**:

```sh
ls -l
-r-x---r-- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File

chmod 760 File

ls -l
-rwxrw---- 1 user user 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File
```

### Linux - File Ownership using `chown` -- change file owner and group

```sh
ls -l
-rwxrwxrwx 1 user001 user001 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File

sudo chown root File

ls -l
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root user001 31337 Feb 11 13:13 File

```
*The chown command requires sudo*


### Linux - Changing the Password using `passwd`

```sh
sudo passwd
```

## Windows - NTFS File & Folder Permissions
NTFS permissions are granted to users and groups on folders and files.

### NTFS Permissions - Folder
* **Full Control** - Anything
* **Modify** - Read, Write and Delete Files and Subfolders
* **Read/Execute** - See contents and Run Programs
* **List** Folder Contents - See Contents of Folders and Subfolders
* **Read** - View Contents and Open data files
* **Write** - Write to Files and Create new files and folders

### NTFS Permissions - File
* **Full Control** - Anything
* **Modify** - Read, Write and Delete files
* **Read/Execute** - Open and Run the file
* **List** Folder Contents - Open the file See Contents of Folders and Subfolders
* **Read** -  Open the file
* **Write** - Open and Write to the file

ðŸ›‘ *Deny is stronger than allow*

### Moving and Copying NTFS Objects
1. **Copy and Move** from drive X: to Y: - will take the NTFS permissions of the **destination** drive.
2. **Copy** from drive X: to the same drive X: - **will loose the NTFS permissions.**
3. **Move** from drive X: to the same drive X: - **will inheritance the NTFS permissions**

## User Account Management

### Continuous Access Monitoring
Monitoring all users account activity

* Track Log on and Log off activity
* Track file access

ðŸ›‘ - Shared Accounts = Bad!!!<br>
ðŸ›‘ - Multiple Accounts = Use different user/pass.<br>
ðŸ›‘ - Use least privilege - enough necessary to accomplish task.<br>
ðŸ›‘ - Monitor and log activity of users with multiple accounts. (Log everything)<br>
ðŸ›‘ - Avoid default usernames on user accounts.

## Triple AAA - Authentication, Authorization and Accounting

Two most popular protocols of triple AAA is RADIUS and TACACS+, providing centralized **Authentication**, **Authorization** and **Account management and registry logging** for computers to connect and use a **network service** securely.

RADIUS or TACACS+ server resides on a remote system and responds to queries from clientes such as VPN clients, wireless access points, routers and switches.

#### How RADIUS and TACACS+ works:

* The server authenticates **username and password** [authentication]
* Determine if a user is **allowed to connect** to the client [authorization]
* **Log** the connection [accounting]

### RADIUS - Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
used for network access

1. **Radius Server**: Get the stack of usernames and passwords (can be MySQL, AD/DS, etc.)
2. **Radius Client**: The Gateway between users and servers
3. **Radius Supplicant**: The person that want to authenticate

**RADIUS can use up to 4 different ports:**

* **1812**
* **1813**
* **1645**
* **1646**

### TACACS+ - Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus
Is really good to manage a big number of network devices.

Provide the same as RADIUS but the service decouple the authorization from the authentication. Manages the authorization better than RADIUS.

**Uses TCP Port 49**  

## Authentication Methods

### **PAP** - Password Authentication Protocol
Is the oldest authentication method. PAP sends username and password **in the clear / plaintext**

### **CHAP** - Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
Uses a hash value of challenge message to authenticate

### **NTLM** - NT LAN Manager for Windows
Similar to the CHAP; uses a challenge hashed message with a different process than CHAP

### **Kerberos** - for AD/DS 
1. Authenticator (Encrypted with user's password)
2. TGT (Encrypted with KDC's key) [ticket-grant-ticket]
3. Resource Ticket (Encrypted with Resource's key by the KDC and issued to the user)
4. Resource Ticket used by Client to access the resources

**Uses Port 88**

<p align="center">
<img width="75%" src="https://www.manageengine.com/products/active-directory-audit/kb/images/event-4771-kerberos-authentication-illustration.jpg" />
</p>

### **SAML** - Security Assertion Markup Language
Used exclusive for **Web Application**

### **LDAP** - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
Query Directories: Structured language that allows one computer to go into somebody's directory and query, update...

**Uses TCP/UDP Port 389**

### Single Sign-On

* **LAN**: Windows Active Directory is dominant for **security SSO**
* **SAML**: SSO for **Web Application** / used to manage multiple apps using a single account

# 5) Risk Management
Risk management is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities.

# Defining Risk

**Vulnerability: A weakness; System flaw**

**Threat: Exploit vulnerabilities to harm assets.**

**Risk: The likelihood of a THREAT exploiting a VULNERABILITY, resulting in a loss.**

**Formulas:**<br>
*threats x vulnerability = risk*<br>
*threats -> vulnerability = risk*

## 1) Asset:
Is a part of an IT infrastructure that has a value. You can measure value either tangibly or intangibly. A gateway router is an example of an asset with tangible value, if it fails, you can easily calculate the cost to replace the router.

Example of assets: 

Asset | Info.
--- | ---
Servers | The computers that offer shared resources
Workstations | The computers users need to do their job

## 2) Probability
Probability means the likelihood - over a defined period of time - of someone or something damaging assets.

**Quantitative likelihood:** based on numbers and data, can be more easy to measure anually.

**Qualitative likelihood:** is more subjective like (low/medium/high).

## 3) Threat actors
A threat actor can be a malicious person, such as a hacker accessing corporate secrets.

**The exam cover six types of threat actor:**
* Hacktivists
* Script Kiddies
* Insiders
* Competitors
* Organized Crime
* Nation State/APT

# Risk Assessment
### 1) Vulnerability Assessment
* NIST SP 800-30
* CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
* Nessus scanner
* Penetration Testing

### 2) Threat Assessment
* **Environmental**: Natural disasters outside the control of humans
* **Manmade**: Any threat that is not environmental
* **Internal**: Threat generated by internal sources, usually an insider to the organization
* **External**: Threat generated from outside your infrastructure 


## Risk Response
*After identified and analyzed risk, you must decide how to responde to the risks produced as a result of the analysis.*
### **1) Risk Mitigation**
Is an attempt to reduce the risk, or at least minimize its effects on an asset.
### **2) Risk Transference**
Or Risk Sharing, deals with risk by sharing with third-party. Example buying insurance to protect against natural disasters.
### **3) Risk Acceptance**
Means the organization has implemented controls and some risk remains. (residual risk). Remember that risk can never be completely eliminated.
### **4) Risk Avoidance**
Means thtat the organization could choose not to participate in activities that cause unnecessary or excessive risk.

## Risk Frameworks
* NIST - Risk Management Framework SP 800-37
* ISACA Risk IT Framework

# Security Controls
The cornerstone of IT security is understanding security controls and how to apply them.

1) **Administrative Control** (People -> IT Security)
    * Laws
    * Policies
    * Guidelines
    * Best Practices 

2) **Technical Control** (IT Systems -> IT Security)
    * Computer stuff
    * Firewalls
    * Password links
    * Authentication
    * Encryption 

3) **Physical Control** (Physical World)
    * Gates
    * Guards
    * Mantraps
    * Keys

## Activity Phase Control Types

1) **Deterrent control**: Deters the actor from **attempting** the threat. *(Warning Sign, SSH Banner)*

2) **Preventive control**: Deters the actor from **performing** the threat. *(Fence, Server Locks, Password Complexity)*

3) **Detective control**: Recognizes an actor's threat. *(Background check, CCTV, IDS)*

4) **Corrective**: Mitigates the impact of a manifested threat. *(Backups)*

5) **Compensating**: Provides alternative fixes to any of the above functions

*Most of security controls are **preventive** phase controls*

## Interesting Security Controls
* Mandatory Vacation
* Job Rotation
* Multi-person Control
* Separation of Duties
* Principle of Least Privilege

# Defense in Depth
Every IT infrastructure might be looked at as a series of concentric shells. The location of these shells depends on the types of threats you are mitigating.

Defense in Depth uses **administrative, physical and technical controls**.

</p>

### **Redundacy**
Repeating the same controls at various intervals.
### **Diversity**
Try different set of security controls in a random pattern.
* **Vendor Diversity**: Uses several vendors to supply equipament and services.

# IT Governance
Influences how the organization conducts IT security.

In its most core function is to actually make the right set of security controls.

1) Laws and Regulations
* HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability - USA)
2) Standards
* **Governament Standards**: NIST, ISO<br>
* **Industry Standards**: PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
3) Best Practices
4) Common-Sense

## Policies
Document that defines how we're going to be doing something. Define Roles and Responsabilities.

## Organizational Standards
Have much more detail than policies. Define the acceptable level of performance policy.

*The security controls come from the policies and standards.*

## Procedures
Step by step process of how to do something.

Security controls, Policies and standards help define and build the **Procedures**.

</p>

# Security Policies
### **The Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**:
Defines what a person can or can not do when using company assets and equipament. *(The paper you sign before entry a job position).*

### **Data Sensitivity and Classification Policies**:
Define the importance or nature of the data. *(i.e. Applying labels on the Government, they use Top Secret, Classified, etc).*

### **Access Control Policies**:
* How people get access to data or resources
* What type of data do users have access to.
* Data access and classification restrictions 
*(It cover a lot of things based on the job type).*

### **Password Policy:**
* Password recovery
* Password retention
* Bad login attempt
* Password reuse
* Complexity

### **Care and Use of Equipament**
How you maintain company equipament.

Are often for customers; defines how your data or usage will be shared with other resoruces. *(i.e. Services like Facebook etc).*

### **Personnel Policies**:
* Background Check
* Mandatory Vacation
* Job Rotation
* Separation of Duties
* Multi-person Control

# Risk Management Frameworks
A framework is a description of a complex process, concentranting on major steps and the flows between the steps. **Describes the major steps and flows of the complex process of applying security controls in an organized and controlled fashion.**

Frameworks come from a variety of sources including:
* **Regulatory**
* **Non-Regulatory**
* **National**
* **Industry Standards (Best Practices)**

## Popular RMF 

**National Standard and Regulatory:**
* NIST SP 800-37

**Non-Regulatory**:
* ISACA IT Infrastructure

**International Standard**:
* ISO 27000

# Quantitative Risk Assessment
Is based on objective data -typically, numerical data; Exact values, for instance, can be used to describe impact or loss of an asset.

## Asset Value (AV)
When valuing an asset, consider not only the replacement cost, but also the revenue the asset generates, as this will be lost as well if the asset is not available.


*Example:*

Asset | Cost | Repair | Revenue | = Total
--|--|--|--|--
**Router** | â‚¬600 | â‚¬500 x day | â‚¬2000 x day | â‚¬3100

## Exposure Factor (EF)
The percentage of an asset that could be lost during a negative event. Realistically, you will not always lose 100% (1) of the asset; you may lose only 20% (0.2) or 50% (0.5) for example. 

*Example:*

Incident | Exposure Value
--|--
Flood | 1 (100%)

## Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
Is the value that's computed simply by multiplying the asset's value by the exposure factor (percentage of loss).

**Formula:**<br>
Single Loss Expectancy = Asset Value x Exposure Factor<br>
**SLE = AV x EF**

*Example (using data below):*

AV | x  EF | = SLE
--|--|--
â‚¬3100 | 1 | â‚¬3100 

SLE = â‚¬3100 (AV) x 1 (EF) = â‚¬3100 

## Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
How many times per year you would expect a particularly negative event to occur, resulting in a loss of the asset. **This value relates more to likelihood than impact.**

*Example:*
Flood on Server room, base on data: one flood in about 10 years, 1/10 (0.1). [SLE x ARO = ALE]

## Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
Essentially looks at the amount of loss from the SLE and determines how much loss the organization could realistically expect in a one-year period. 

**Formula**:<br>
ALE (Annualized loss expectancy) = SLE x ARO<br>
**SLE x ARO = ALE**


# Business Impact Analysis
Designed to mitigate the effects of an incident, **not to prevent an incident**.

* Determine mission process. *(make sure servers are up)*
* Identify critical systems.
* Single point-of-failure. *(using Defense-in-Depth...)*
* Identify resource requirements.
* Identify recovery priorities. *(prioritize most important steps to kepp whatever essential function running)*

## Types of Impact
* Property
* Safety / Life / People
* Finance (Credit, Cash flows...)
* Reputation
* Privacy

### **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and Privacy Threshold Assessment (PTA)**
PIA: Determine the impact on the privacy of the individuals who data is beign stored; and ensure that the organization has sufficient security controls applied to be within compliance of applicable laws or standards.

To create a **(PIA) - Privacy Impact Assessment**, the organization needs to perform a **(PTA) - Privacy Threshold Assessment** on its infrastructure to locate **personal information**, what personal info. is stored and from whom the personal info is collected.

*PTA and PIA - in order to understand the impact of the loss of personal information can do to a particular business.*

## Calculating Impact
Determine how long the particular equipament going to last. (qualitative)

<p align="center">
<img  width="70%" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Samsar4/62886aac358c3d484a0ec17e8eb11266/raw/13cf0c9fbcd0acba680220cce03829cbf0ce1506/MTBF.png" />
</p>

* **MTTF = Mean Time to Failure**
* **MTTR = Mean Time to Repair**
* **MTBF = Mean Time Between Failure**

## Recovery Time Objective (RTO):
* Maximum amount of time that a resource may remain unavailable before an unacceptable impact on other system resources occurs.
## Recovery Point Objective (RPO):
* Defines de amount of time that will pass between an incident and recovery from backup.

*Recovery priorities help define what needs to be addressed to maintain business continuity.*

# Organizing Data
The first step to dealing with data security is **organization**.

* Analyze individual chuncks of data (such as databases, files, access control lists..)
* Determine the importance - **the sensitivity of data.**

## Data Sensitivity | Labeling
* **Public Data**: Has no restrictions. (stills needs integrity and availability)

* **Confidential Information**: Limited to authorized viewing as agreed by the parties involved.

* **Private Information**:social security number, passport number, PII - Peronally identifiable information...

* **Proprietary Information**: Information owned by a company that gives a certain competitive advantages. (i.e. The secret formula of Coca-Cola).

* **PHI - Protected Health Information**: Not only Health information, PII may include on PHI.

## Data Roles
* **Owner of the data / Data Owner**: Legally responsible for the data, can be entity responsible.

* **Steward / Custodian**: Maintain the accuracy and integrity of data.

* **Privacy Officer**: Ensures data adhere to privacy policies and procedures.

## User Roles
* **Users**: Assigned standard permissions to complete tasks. | Must understand how system functions works and have proper security training to recognize common issues (Malware, etc).

* **Privileged Users**: Increased access and control over the data or system. (i.e. a Normal user can run anti-malware software, but the privileged can updated then).

* **Executive Users**: Concentrates on strategic decisions including policy review, incident response and disaster recovery.

* **System Administrator**: Has complete direct control over the data or system. (Can remove or add users, applying permissions, and doing system maintance...) 

* **Data Owner | System Owner**: People or organizations who have legal ownership of this particular data set or particular system.

# Security Training

### **Onboarding**:
New hires or contractors
* Background check
* NDA (Non-disclosure agrement)
* Standard Operation Procedures

### **Offboarding**:
When the employee leaves the company
* Disable accounts (never delete an account)
* Return Credentials
* Exit interview
* Knowledge transfer

## Personnel Management Controls
* **Mandatory Vacation**: 
    * Required
    * Prevents collusion
    * Dependency issues
    * Makes fraud harder

* **Job Rotation**:
    * Redundancy and Backup
    * Allows for cross-training
    * Makes fraud harder

* **Separation of Duties**:
    * Requires dual execution *(at least two people to do a sensitive function)*

* **Multi-Person control**:
    * Moren than one person required in a task/function

## Role-Based Data Controls
* **System Owner**:
    * Management level role
    * Maintains security of the system
    * Defines a system administrator
    * Works with all **Data Owners** to ensure data security

### **Obfuscation**
Hidden sensitive data - providing confidentiality


### **Classic Algorithms - by Substituition**
* **Caesar Cipher** (ROT1-25) - *The earliest known and simples ciphers*
* **VigenÃ¨re Cipher** *(Employs the Caesar cipher as one element of the encryption process + the key)*

### **Kerkchoff Principle**
The crypto algorithm should be public and the key is the secret.

### Where to **Encrypt & Decrypt**?
* **Data-at-Rest**: Resides in storage
* **Data-in-Transit**: Transport / Network
* **Data-in-Process**: RAM & CPU

### **Symmetric Encryption**
* Fast
* One Single Key / Session Key to encryption and decryption
* Primary way to encrypt data
* Ephemeral Key
  * Temporary
  * Provides perfect forward secrecy

### **Asymmetric Encryption**
* Slow
* Uses a Key pair **(Public Key and Private Key)**  
   * Public Key - encrypt
   * Private Key - decrypt

### Cryptosystem
Defines key properties, communication requirements for the key exchange; actions through encryption and decryption process.

*(Ex: Using asymetric encryption to exchange Session keys after that communicate using Symmetric encryption.)*

### **Symmetric CryptoSystems** 

Algorithm | Block or Streaming | Block Size | Rounds | Key Size | Notes
--|--|--|--|--|--
**DES** | Block | 64-bit | 16 | 56 bits | Uses five modes of operation: ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB and CTR.

**AES** | Block | 128-bit | 10, 12, or 14 | 128, 192 or 256 bits | Encryption standard for the US Gov.
**RC4** | Streaming | N/A | 1 | 40-2048 bits | Used in WEP, SSL and TLS; largely deprecated in current technologies.

*Rounds: Repeating the XOR/left-shift iteration X times.*

### **Block modes**
* **ECB** - Eletronic Code Block *(deprecated because nowdays is a week method that always produces the same output results with same input)*

*All block modes below uses IV, which ensures the output block is uniquely different*
* **CBC** - Cipher Block Chaining
* **CFB** - Cipher Feedback
* **OFB** - Output Feedback 
* **CTR** - Counter

*A **Binary Block** is a plaintext converted into 16-bit, 64-bit or 128-bit binary ciphertext.*

## Asymmetric Algorithms
### RSA
Rivest Shamir and Edelman - Asymmetric algorithm, **generates the private and public key**.

### ECC
Elliptic Curve Cryptography - Can create a smaller key than RSA, provides the same security with increased performance (more faster).

### Diffie-Hellman
* **Does not** use Public or Private keys
* Uses key exchange protocol
* Diffie Hellman groups help by defining the size or type of key structure to use: 

**Diffie Hellman Groups**
Group | Size
--|--
Group 1 | 768-bit modulus 
Group 2 | 1024-bit modulus 
Group 5 | 1536-bit modulus 
Group 14 | 2048 bit modulus 
Group 19 | 256-bit elliptic curve 
Group 20 | 384-bit elliptic curve 
Group 21 | 521-bit elliptic curve 


## PGP - Pretty Good Privacy

  * Free Toolset
  * File and Disk encryption

## Hashing
One-way encryption providing integrity.

Hash | Algo.
--|--
MD5 | 128 bit hash
SHA-1 | 160 bit hash

**SHA-1 and MD5 has the same cryptographic flaws, that can cause hash collision.**

### **SHA-2** Family
SHA-256 | minor version: SHA-224<br>
SHA-512 | minor version: SHA-384

### **SHA-3** 
Uses a hash function called Keccack and has the same length of SHA-2. 

SHA-1 and SHA-2 have been replaced by the latest iteration of SHA known as SHA-3.

### **RIPEMD**
RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest.
* Not very common 
* Open Standard
* 128, 168, 256, 320 bit digests

### **HMAC**
Hash Message Authentication Code - Used in conjunction with symmetric key both to authenticate and verify integrity of the message.

* Provides message integrity

* Requires each side of the conversation to have the same key

* It is based on standard hashes (SHA-1, MD5, etc)

## Steganography
The art of hide information inside the data (hide data within data), and can be encrypted.

## Certificates and Trust
* Certificates include a public key and at least one digital signature.

### Digital Signature
* To create a digital signature for a document, you hash the document using your private key. Others can verify your digital signature with your public key.

### **Web of Trust**
* Web of Trust uses a web of mutually trusting peers.
* Requires a lots of maintenance

### **PKI** - Public Key Infrastructure
Is a system consisting of hardware, software, policies and procedures that creates, manage, distributes, uses, store and revoke **DIGITAL CERTIFICATES.**

PKI is the way we do internet. Uses a hierarchical structure with root servers.

* Certificate Authority (CA): Issues the certificates (Verisign, Thawte, etc).

### **CRL - Certificate Revocation List**
A list of serial numbers of certificates that have been revoked or are no longer valid, therefore should not be relied on.

* Downside it is slow and old.

### **OCSP - Online Certificate Status Protocol**
Is a more modern version of CRL that are used today, have a better performance.

### Common Types of Digital Certificates:
* **PKCS-7**: is a way to store certificates as individual files.
* **PKCS-12**: stores the certificates and the private keys as packages.
* **X.509** 

## Cryptographic Attacks
* Brute Force 
* Dictionary Attack
* Rainbow Table (dictionary of hashes)
* Collision Attack
* Replay Attack

### **Salt**
Salt is an arbitrary value, usually created by the application or OS storing passwords, added to the end of the password before it is hashed, making cracking harder.

*Example*:
```
> Password: 123456
> Salt (arbitrary): aksfle3t

> Concatenated with Salt: 123456aksfle3t

> Salted password (SHA-256): 02FCD2C88B089D2E1816070FFF8B80E13242264DA14233A57821CDAF4DDA45DF
```

### **Keystretching**
Combine a very long salt and a huge number of hashing iterations to make cracking even more harder.

Two most popular Key derivation functions
* PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm
* BCrypt algorithm

*Example*:
```
PBKDF2 

Password:
123456

Hash:
rYoSDg62evyzhE1+lWBa9A==:YaeMu71c8KU3H0RYFPle0Q==

--------------------------

BCrypt

Password: 
123456

Hash:
$2b$10$vES9mCPsE10//vOc1u01XeUVmJrZyHGMPaRfo39OIUoJ2g7iPtDnu
